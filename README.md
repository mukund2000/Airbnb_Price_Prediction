# Airbnb_Price_Prediction
The purpose of this task is to predict the price of NYC Airbnb rentals based on the data provided and any external dataset(s) with relevant information.
Airbnb is a home-sharing platform that allows home-owners and renters (‘hosts’) to put their properties (‘listings’) online, so that guests can pay to stay in them. Hosts are expected to set their own prices for their listings. Although Airbnb and other sites provide some general guidance, there are currently no free and accurate services which help hosts price their properties using a wide range of data points.

# Motivation
There were several motivation factors for picking this project which are listed as below:
1. Trying to monitor and understand the underlying pricing dynamics of the Airbnb market.

2. 60 million people in 34,000 cities across the world and is continuing to grow quickly.

3. Airbnb provides a convenient source of income for people who have otherwise vacant space and for guests looking for affordable and convenient housing options.

4. Paid third party pricing software is available, but generally you are required to put in your own expected average nightly price (‘base price’), and the algorithm will vary the daily price around that base price on each day depending on day of the week, seasonality, how far away the date is, and other factors.

5. Airbnb pricing is important to get right, particularly in big cities like London where there is lots of competition and even small differences in prices can make a big difference. It is also a difficult thing to do correctly — price too high and no one will book. Price too low and you’ll be missing out on a lot of potential income.

# Objective
1. To  predict the price of NYC Airbnb rentals based on the data provided and any external dataset(s) with relevant information.

2. Optimized  profit and affordability. 

3. To build a model that predicts the optimal price of a property taking into account listing features and seasonality.
 
4. The end goal is so users can understand what features of an Airbnb listing are most important as well as how prices should be fluctuating based on seasonality.

5. to ensure sustainable development and improve the economic stability of a nation. 

6. However, the main objective of this project is to introduce ourselves to the domain of machine learning.

7. Through the project we shall be able to rigorously apply machine learning to our problems.

8. After the project we shall have all the necessary background for fundamental machine learning research.

# Conclusion
In recent years, the so-called sharing economy has spread all over the world and, through the proliferation of online peer-to-peer platforms, provides a marketplace that matches sellers who want to sell/share their underutilised assets with buyers who need them. One of the well-known and heavily debated manifestations of the sharing economy is an accommodation provider platform called Airbnb. Airbnb is experiencing astonishing growth provoking several intense debates, regulatory challenges, and political battles due to its wide-spread effects on rental and real-estate markets. Thus, it is important to analyse the uneven spatial effects of the phenomenon.
The aim of our project is to map Airbnb’s presence in New York City but, going beyond visual inspection, it analyses the socio-economic factors influencing the spatiality of Airbnb in the American metropolis. After collecting data from various data sources, we performed a statistical analysis (correlation, regression analysis) to determine the socio-economic conditions of areas and revealed those factors that may affect the spatial distribution of Airbnb listings in the city.Results highlight that (1) Airbnb supply concentrates in those parts of New York City with a young population, (2) there is a significant number of housing units, and (3) the number of points of interest is high.
